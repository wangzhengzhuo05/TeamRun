// contract, not a renderer concern. Both the renderer (replaying a snapshot
// into an xterm) and the daemon (seeding a cold-restored session) must clear
// the same mode bits, and duplicating the literals drifted them apart (#12101).

// Why: SerializeAddon replays mode bits assuming reattach to a live TUI, but TeamRun restores against a fresh shell with none, so stale bits (e.g. focus reporting rings the bell on click) must be reset.

 * escape — and earlier revisions of this reset covered those too. They are
 * dropped here because each one changes what a live TUI sees on a path that
 * runs in production, none of them has a reported symptom behind it, and the
 * pen is what the field reports actually show (STA-4042). Widen this only with
 * a symptom to point at.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a soft reset (DECSTR) either: xterm's DECSTR wipes kitty
 * flags and stacks (see terminal-kitty-keyboard-mode-tracker applySoftReset),
 * which would silence Option chords for a live agent that negotiates them only
 * at startup.
